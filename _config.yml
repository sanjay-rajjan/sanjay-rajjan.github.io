  Hello, I’m Sanjay Rajjan, a student at Prosper High School. I started learning computer programming in middle school through the Make.Hack.Build program at [Do Space](https://dospace.org). I’m also a member of the varsity tennis team at PHS. I enjoy playing and coaching chess in my free time. 
  
  I founded the Chess Club at Prosper High School and established a non-profit organization called <mark>[Chess Together](https://chess-together.org)</mark> to teach chess to kids and special children. I’ve coached over 30 kids through the PHS Chess Club and Chess Together Non-Profit organization.

          My interests are centered on computer science in High school. I took *AP Computer Science Principles* and am currently doing *AP Computer Science A* to further improve my skills and knowledge in this area. 
          
          I also have a deep passion for artificial intelligence and data science due to the emergence of AI and its potential to be an integral part of our society, especially in the future. 
          
          I also have taken *AP Statistics* in high school as one of my classes because it is particularly very useful for data science.
