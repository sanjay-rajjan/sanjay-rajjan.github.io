about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I'm [Sanjay Rajjan](https://sanjay.rajjan.com/), a Prosper High School senior passionate about computer programming. I ignited this passion in middle school through the Make.Hack.Build program at [Do Space](https://dospace.org). Outside of coding, I'm a member of the PHS varsity tennis team.
    
  Leadership is also a strong suit. I founded the Chess Club at Prosper High School and even established a non-profit, [Chess Together](https://chess-together.org), to bring chess to kids and children with special needs. I've proudly coached over 30 kids through these initiatives.

          My interests are centered on computer science in High school. I took *AP Computer Science Principles* and am currently doing *AP Computer Science A* to further improve my skills and knowledge in this area. 
          
          I also have a deep passion for artificial intelligence and data science due to the emergence of AI and its potential to be an integral part of our society, especially in the future. 
          
          I also have taken *AP Statistics* in high school as one of my classes because it is particularly very useful for data science.

            Won Free AVR-IoT Cellular Mini Hardware for this project.
            The project involves the development of a system that uses the AVR-IoT Cellular Mini to monitor waste levels in garbage bins across a city. The system is designed to send alerts to the cityâ€™s waste management department when the waste level in a bin reaches a certain threshold, indicating that the bin needs to be emptied.
